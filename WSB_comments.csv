13,l8rf4k,"**Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The  number of posts with supposed  ""level headed"" advice about how a short  squeeze is much more difficult  to achieve than we all think, how other  stocks are also valuable, and  how the strong and powerful hedge funds  have much more cards up their  sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but  still ""Go GME!! I am one of  you guys!"", always with a few rewards  sticked to them, is exploding and  will be getting progressively worse  in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS   check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting   swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh   how desperate they now have become.

Usually a short squeeze happens over the course of a day or two. But this one is different. This has turned into a series of smaller short squeezes. They know most of us are expecting the traditional, obvious mega- squeeze, so the funds and other pricks are disguising their short covers - doing it slowly. They think the longer they do that, the lower our PT will be because we will begin to think the squeeze isn’t coming.

 But as the price is 🚀 they are also putting in new shorts (including new people doing the same). rationally, which we know nothing about, it’s a sound bet at this point, but we hold all the 🍌. 

So keep holding, the squeeze has not squoze, but rather the squeezes have begun squizzin. Keep fucking holding.

When hedge funds pull out of MSFT, it'll come down, algo trading will sell off more and there will be at least a flash crash. IF YOU ARE NEAR RETIREMENT AGE YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR IRA MONEY TO BONDS IMMEDIATELY. Wait out the GME situation, if GME moons the market will crash and you can buy back in, if GME emptys all of our pockets then just buy back in.

**On behalf of all fellow introverts, lurkers and silent observers - I just want to say we on this with you** 

Given all the activity this sub has seen lately, this may get lost into oblivion and that's okay.

Let me start of by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private. However, Reddit has been my staple for information, jokes, wholesomememes, motivation, nsfwgifs and a lot more for more than 6 years.

And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way. I may not afford to buy a billboard or a fly a plane to express my feelings - I may not even have the smarts to write a witty meme or two. Hell, I don't even know how to add those clever ""diamond hands"" icons (can someone teach me?). But, I can assure you that I've got your back. WE, have your back.

The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words.

AND, I am certain there are many like me who may not post about how many stocks they've bought, how much they've lost or gained and how excited they are to go to the moon and beyond, but I can can assure you they are holding.

WE are with you on this, though you may not see us. WE are with you on this, though you may not hear us shout. WE are with you on this all the way.

Good luck and god speed.

PS: This is not a financial advise (it clearly isn't) and not not a financial advisor (I am clearly not). So, do what you heart tells you to - play games, watch a movie or type an email on your phone.",glfh9ad,1612083797.0,2021-01-31 11:03:17

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

- User [R] pointed out that Robinhood is owned by Citedal, a hedge fund that along side with Point72 injected ~$3B into Melvin. Standing to lose a shitton of money to us degenerates. This further points out why Robinhood  is trying to manipulate the market to help out the suits at Wall St.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.",gl3gkwl,1611874195.0,2021-01-29 00:49:55

Market Abuse Regulation. Robinhood is acting in the self interest of a third party by not allowing assets to be purchased that are allowed on all other stock exchanges. 

Robinhood is the only trader that isn’t allowing purchases of Nok, BB, AMC, GME. 

Other institutional traders are allowing new purchases as outlined by their regulations.

Fastest way, if you have another brokerage account at fidelity, Etrade, vanguard, etc.. You can simultaneously sell your robinhood and buy shares from the other account without impacting the share price. It will be a net zero.

Otherwise open an account at another brokerage, and do the same thing.

Lastly, you can request all shares be transferred to another the brokerage. This can take up to weeks.

Seems Robinhood will be holding the line here. The 'loss' you take under Robinhood will be used as evidence in a class action lawsuit later. that will take time. but to buy and trade and kill these institutional investors, you need to hold the line. THEY ARE WINNING

They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

WE LIKE THE STOCK

KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

Limit order set to $5,000+💎🙌🏻🚀

491,l78uct,"Just bought 140 shares this evening. 

Thank you RK for your initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world.

Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under?

I'm in this company because I believe in its status as a symbol of a modern age story of change, adaptation, innovation and community or grass-roots backed financing.

If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry.

GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality.

People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight. Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.

Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.

GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest?

Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it.

I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this.

Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides.

502,l78uct,"**Melvin Capital lost tremendous amounts of money due to over-extended shorting of Gamestock (GME) stock. Retail investors discovered this and began buying the security to leverage against their position. Melvin Capital was granted close to 2.7 billion dollars in loans by Citadel Securities, LLC (investment firm) for liquidity.**

**Citadel Securities (market maker) processes ROBINHOOD FINANCIAL, LLC’s transactions. To prevent further losses, they potentially pressured Robinhood to restrict buying of specific stocks such as GME, AMC, NOK, and others by retail investors. As of 1/28, GME is specifically blocked from being bought on Robinhood - an unprecedented event following no actual SEC rules or Robinhood terms and conditions.**

**Other retail trading sites continue to allow trades - this is Robinhood specifically curtailing market action, likely under specific pressure from Citadel and Citadel Securities.**
**Note that although they are separate corporate entities, Citadel and Citadel Securities are owned by the same individual - Ken Griffin.**

**These companies seem to be colluding behind the scenes to block legitimate investment actions by individuals, to their own profit. Their communications may reveal this manipulation.**

**Thus:**
**We make the argument that Robinhood Financial, LLC in coordination with Citadel Securites, LLC and Melvin Capital Management, LP willfully engaged in market manipulation by restricting buying power of the security GME by actionably preventing its users from exercising their financial leverage to cover their position. This has resulted in immeasurable losses to millions of users unable to trade the security in a way that is financially in their best interest according to their own belief.**

**Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security.**",gl5jzzt,1611900327.0,2021-01-29 08:05:27

811,l846a1,"Re: Gamestop

Fellow humans: This is more than a meme. This is more than a way to earn a quick dollar. This is more than a way to fuck over rich people. This is a social movement. This is a grassroots push for a more equitable system. This is a way to expose corruption and greed. This is a way to force the system to change.

What happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market. They borrowed shares of Gamestop, sold them, and trashed the company publicly in an attempt to force Gamestop out of business. Aside from being wildly unethical, these wealthy people leveraged financial tools (short selling on margin/naked short selling) that only exist to make rich people richer. These tools exist for no other purpose. They do not add any value to our society. What they did is analogous to betting that your grandma will die, and then killing her yourself.

What does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down. It means that they stand to lose billions of dollars. It means that many of us “amateur” traders stand to permanently change our circumstances. It means we can afford rent and food without going into debt, buy our first house, pay off our student loans, pay for our kids’ schools, invest in our retirements, start small businesses, pursue a passion, PROGRESS in life. Perhaps most importantly, it provides us with a VOICE. 

What can you do: Identify and contact your local, state and federal representatives. Tell them that if anything fishy happens with the Gamestop situation, you will never ever vote for them again. Make your voice heard on social media. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that “these reddit people are crazy, this stock is worthless, innocent people are going to get hurt, this undermines the mechanics of the free market, etc.” That is all bullshit. The fact of the matter is, the wealthy people mentioned above are panicking, and are willing to say anything to undermine the cause and hold onto their ill-begotten wealth. 

If you like the $GME stock as much as I do, BUY IT AND HOLD IT. I am not a financial advisor, I am not “smart” enough. I am just a concerned individual who likes the stock.

I know you are anxious!  I know you want to be rollin deep with that Ric Flair drip.  And here’s how, stop selling.  

If you want to make money in this, stop placing market sell orders.  A market sell order means you will sell whatever the current amount that someone is willing to pay.  Today there was a lot of that going on cause you can tell the the price was flat around 315 rather than 🚀🚀🚀

If you want to sell and make bank and show love for the rest of us, place a limit order.  That means your stock won’t sell until someone buys at the price YOU want.  Not just lay down at what the fund managers want, drive that price up by setting your LIMIT order above the last price.  But don’t set it $1 above the last sale, set it 10,20,30 clams higher.  

This only works if we work together.  Enough of the stagnant crap send this to the 🚀🚀🚀

When this ""event"" is over, I will transfer 90% of my money off Robinhood.

I spread my trades between RH and TD and applied for a new account on Webull. I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket.

I can see the spike happening when we get the short squeeze going, then they just tell us that the system went down, or there is network traffic, while we tried to cash in our gains. They could steal thousands of dollars each from us. (Or millions)

I threw down the most I was allowed. 100% of my TD Ameritrade account is now GME and AMC. I have the most allowed on RH. That is as ""all-in"" as they will let me do.

I predict Deepfuckingvalue will NEVER sell and that he will join the “bag holders” intentionally.  Because that is the best move for him in the long run, IMO.  He has clearly demonstrated that he is a long run thinker,  becoming the bag holder is the ultimate currency for him, IMO.

He will become as wealthy as he wants to become on future plays.  He personally does not need the GME play to create wealth. 

Going forward Deepfuckingvalue will be able to make a stock go parabolic with ONE post.  With this level of power and influence, he will end up very wealthy, in the next two years.  He just needs a few more trades.  He will now be able to move a stock as fast as Musk can with a tweet.

Something like this has never ever happened in the 204 years the stock market has been active. Hedge funds and market makers have been taking risky gambles, crashing markets and making ridiculous moves for years that have effected each and everyone of us, our families and our elders, and one finally got caught with their hand in the cookie jar and now we are the irresponsible bad guys. 

The frustrating thing about this, is that is has made national headlines about “GameStop shouldn’t be priced this high, it's a failing company"", “it makes no sense”, “these message board kids are acting very irresponsibly”. It has nothing to do with fucking GameStop, it could be Ken and Fucking Barbie for all that it matters. These fucking idiots cant fucking see that its about the fucking risky ass bet the hedge fund took, that they now are on the hook for, and they are doing everything they can, shutting down apps, halting stocks, calling on their government buddies to help them pull strings and bail them out, but WE are the ones acting irresponsibly. 

Absolutely not. Fuck every bit of that.

1037,l881ia,"I wonder how many of these companies that are being heavily shorted by hedge funds were allowed to receive PPP loans from taxpayers, only to have to government let the billionaire hedge funds keep shorting them to the ground.  And they dare call us criminals.  Seems to me like the criminals are the politicians allowing these hedge funds to keep shorting while tbe heavily shorted companies were receiving taxpayer dollars to keep them afloat.  

Seems like legal money laundering to me, on a grand scale.  No different than what the JP Morgan and Wells Fargo of the world have been allowed to do, and then only receiving a slap on the wrist and paying fines that to them equals peanuts. Common sense is not that common among many folks these days.  It appears to be that common sense says, any company receiving taxpayer PPP loans to keep them afloat during a pandemic can't systematically be allowed to be shorted to the ground by hedge funds, pillaging off the taxpayers, the American people.  

So the loans were approved and sent stat! To those big companies most in need, only to keep them solvent long enough to keep the billionaire hedge funds making money on open short positions.  

My diamond 💎 handed soldiers, please up vote this to get some ppl to dig in and find out which of these companies fit this profile.  

Many folks take things at face value, they walk into a restaurant, order food, see the beautiful place and great tasting food, and never bother asking or going to see what the kitchen looks like and meet the chefs.  

I am one who questions everything, I want to see behind the curtain, I demand to see how the food you're feeding me is made.  FTW! BTFD!

1075,l881ia,"Man,  these past couple weeks have been amazing. I've been following along  with the group for a couple years, but seriously for the last couple  weeks. It's been to the point where I don't want to sleep because I  don't want to miss any of the action. Unfortunately, I'm unemployed and  was born with hands made for origami.

This week that has all changed.

After  belly laughing through posts and comments on Tuesday, I said screw it.  I'm joining in. I really liked the stock and thought the growth  potential was exponential. I bought 2 shares Tuesday around $110 and  yes, I used my origami fingers to create a sell limit order of $420.69.  On Thursday morning I woke up and saw my stocks had sold and I was okay  with it.

In the meantime I watch  my major holdings AAPL beat earnings and get absolutely smoked. That was  a breaking point, making me realize I was stupid, but needed to be  retarded. I figured AAPL was being driven down by the shorts who were  liquidating and I said screw it, I'm selling too.

Friday  afternoon I watched the market tank after my favorite native american  politician said the market should be based on fundamentals. I then came  to this group and saw the diamond hands were in full force and the  conviction was strong beyond belief. I put in an order for 20 shares  @$275 and I'm here to be the best autist I can be thanks to you guys. No  more paper cranes for these hands, diamonds only!

I've  enjoyed this immensely and can't wait for the suits to crap their bed  pans come next week. I really like this stock and think the growth  potential is still significant. (ROCKET, DIAMOND, HAND EMOJIS)",glc81av,1612013215.0,2021-01-30 15:26:55

people were expecting this to boom AH but this is a misconception. The truth is, the rise in price we have held this week will now create a large increase in the interest that these hedge funds have on their borrowed stock. 

This increase in interest is a cost for short sellers and will motivate them to close their position and drive the stock price higher. This increase in price will higher the rate of interest for other short sellers creating a panic-chain affect and ‘squeeze’ the shorts out. 

This will bring immense value to AMC and GME given the massive amounts of shorts that are currently holding positions. AMC 86% shorted!!! 

Just hold your position and wait for them to crack, the higher the price and longer this goes on, the more and more interest those hedges have to pay. It’s a matter of time till they crack.

I started doing Robinhood last spring, looked  at Gamestop's stock sitting at $2/3 and laughed. It was mismanaged,  treated their employees like shit, and had *just*  pivoted to being a more ""social"" atmosphere, right when Covid hit. I  didn't think Gamestop would last the year, and I'll probably regret it  the rest of my life, but I jumped on the rocket today at 3 hundo, trying  to buy more but all I have is Robinhood and they're being the Sheriff  right now.

AMC tho. A lot of us  thought Covid wouldn't last as long as it has, so AMC was down with oil,  and I bought 10 shares thinking when things go back to normal, it would  explode.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

Edit: Fellow Regarded, please buy more GME and Hold 💎🤚🏾 the rewards helps with visibility but it’s better spent there.

Edit 2: 
I’m getting a lot of questions regarding the same things so I’ll try my best to answer them. 
- For FINRA online complaint, scroll down to the section reading “Problems addressed by FINRA” under it click the Orange button that reads “FILE ONLINE COMPLAINT” 
- FINRA CRD NUMBER: 165998 [ Thanks u/Mattcwh ]
- User [R] pointed out that Robinhood is owned by Citedal, a hedge fund that along side with Point72 injected ~$3B into Melvin. Standing to lose a shitton of money to us degenerates. This further points out why Robinhood  is trying to manipulate the market to help out the suits at Wall St. 
- Lots of questions concerning the Security type. If it’s for GME you put it under CLASS A OR D Securities.

Edit 5 and cleanup edit: At this moment, I am continuing to get mixed reporting on abilities to trade in stocks on multilpe platforms. At this time, it appears generally Fidelity and Vangaurd are working, if they are not it is most likely a server issue due to increased load and traffic. At this time it appears that **ONLY** Robinhood has blatantly blocked the ability to trade. *But, I have heard mixed reporting on inabilities to trade on other platforms.*

Edit 6: tastyworks has removed trade restrictions.

On January 28th, at approximately 8:30am EST, Robinhood Markets, Inc. chose to restrict purchase of the GameStop (NYSE:GME) security through their mobile app on iOS and Android, as well as via their browser-based online portal.

There was no government or NYSE-mandated halt or suspension in place at this time. GME was placed in a ""reduce only"" state, where positions could be exited, but additional shares could not be purchased.

In addition to this being a gross violation of free market principles, this is also a violation of my rights as a call option holder, as I can no longer exercise my options.

As defined by them (and understood by the industry at large):

""Buying to open an options position means that you’re purchasing the contract. You’re the owner, and have the right to place an order to sell the contract back into the market, to exercise the contract, or to let it expire.""

\- [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/options-knowledge-center/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/options-knowledge-center/)

Since their restriction, I can no longer exercise my legally-purchase options, which I maintain is a violation of my options contract.

I believe this was done to manipulate the market at the behest of the firms Robinhood uses to actually execute trades, but that is just my theory.

What I do know is that they sold me options contracts with ""the right"" to exercise them, but are now preventing me from doing so. In the opinion of my lawyer, this constitutes fraud.",gl3iciv,1611874687.0,2021-01-29 00:58:07

I’m thinking failure to execute orders that it had received (yesterday) and denying access to markets with the end result of damaging investors by excluding them from the markets.

For yesterday, RH seems to be in violation of FINRA Rule 5310, which states that RH “must make every effort to execute a marketable customer order that it receives promptly and fully.” Many people had orders that were entered and then cancelled yesterday.

Today, investors are being damaged by not being able to access the markets and buy more shares (which may be market manipulation under 7 USC §9(3) or 15 USC §78i(a)(2) since they are artificially affecting demand for multiple securities). Under this part, Robinhood would likely be liable for any profit they could have made by buying more stocks today or, if the price collapses, the losses they took that could have been prevented by large-scale share purchases.

You can rest easy that your **cash and securities will not disappear** in the very unlikely event that [Robinhood](https://www.investingsimple.com/go/robinhood) crashes financially or goes bankrupt.

Your investments are protected under SIPC insurance, with the exception being cryptocurrency.

Cash within the savings account is protected under FDIC. Lastly, cash held within your brokerage account for the purpose of investing is protected as part of SIPC.

One final reminder, no one is insuring you against losses experienced from investing!

1352,l6x130,"Imagine one company that you invested in (Robinhood) is causing your other company that you invested in (Melvin Capital) to lose a shit ton of money. What do you do? Enter, Ken Griffin.

Ken Griffin, owner of Citadel, happens to be a large investor of Robinhood. Citadel gave $2B+ to Melvin Capital, which happens to be one of GameStop's biggest shorts. It's likely that Ken Griffin asked Robinhood's board/CEO to limit trades on $GME and some other heavily shorted stocks because his investments are losing money as a result.

Robinhood is basically only allowing you to sell out of your positions, causing a drop in the stock price. Citadel also happens to work with TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, which have tightened margin trade requirements, meaning you gotta have more money on hand to do option trading.

In essence, you see institutional investors unhindered because of pre-market and after-market trading. But with Robinhood limiting $GME trades, retail investors are now screwed because they're limited from initiating options and buys into $GME, dropping the stock price and protecting shorts from gamma squeezes (short squeezes) that have made the stock go up. Robinhood is manipulating the market. And that's what the lawsuit is about.

Ken Griffin is likely the person requesting Robinhood to limit $GME trades.",gl58bs2,1611896177.0,2021-01-29 06:56:17

Second, cannot buy calls. This will stop the upward momentum of buying newly strikes every day.

Third and possibly most importantly calls that are held without capital to exercise them are going to be the undoing of this short squeeze. The owners of the calls will not be able to roll them over into the next week because they can't buy new ones. This means that they have to sell their call back to the MM, and the MM will unwind their hedge pushing the amount of shares available through the roof and will tank the price.

While not needing to pay a MASSIVE amount now... It’s almost like debt they’ll have for life, unless they want to pay it off, which appears they’re trying hard not to do! Imagine not paying your taxes but you had to pay a fine that was less than the total of your taxes.. In my simple mind, it makes sense for them to slowly bleed and make that back over time than attempt fate and risk the entire market by allowing the stock price to sky rocket, which may be inevitable. Remember patience is key! Don’t gamble what you’re not willing to lose, do you like the stock or not? 🧐

When a brilliant guy like DFV comes along and shows an incredible success self-made story of a generation, no news program even cares to put him on their shows. They rather interview  idiot boomer suits who've never done anything other than speak off the cuff about shit they don't even understand like it's a sunday talk show. DFV had the brains to see an opportunity almost no else saw and also had the balls to put his own money behind it. That's an important distinction: Fucking Idiot Plotkin once he burns through the 13 billion in his fund, he will still have a few hundred million in savings and really doesn't give a fuck about worrying too much going forward. He can just follow that boomer narrative that this was all unfair and not a reflection on how brilliant he is as an investor and has daddy Cohen to vouch for him. And where do you think the 13 billion he has in his fund comes from? A lot of it probably comes from pension funds. So yeah this little idiot bitch is playing with our retirement money like it's fucking monopoly, he's bullying businesses into bankruptcy and when things don't start going his way he's resorting to market manipulation tactics and having cnbc put out fake stories that he's out of his investment when we all can see the short interest has barely moved from 140%. These fuckers are so entitled to getting their way that they can't possibly imagine that regular people having fun can also collaborate online to build compelling investment thesis and put their own money behind it. Also these fucking idiots would know that there is no fucking consensus in this board, just take a look at DFV's history and most people were calling him a boomer idiot a few months ago (obviously those guys are now permabanned for insulting our daddy DFV).

>Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:  
Funds  can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices.  And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem  like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short  strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease  in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of  10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered  the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.  
If  you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up  aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy  land.  
So for a small amount of  shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save  shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the  new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but  shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they  used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells  the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel  like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate  GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are  likely fucked

**EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻**

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg\_WU-0AQ&ab\_channel=StocksBigPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays)

**WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?**

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game.

-----

**Why are the share prices dropping?**

The hedgies cannot afford to pay us $1000's per share.

This is dropping, because they are using dirty tactics to try and make us crumble.

The hedgies are using lots of tactics, with the most common being short ladder attacks.

-----

**What is a short ladder attack in retard language?**

A short ladder attack is basically falsely manipulated stock prices.

Think of three people sitting around a table buying shares from the person to their left, and selling to the person on their right.

They are trading low volumes of shares at low prices to make it look like that is the real price of the share; thus impacting the market.

-----

**Why is holding so important?**

Every time you sell, the hedgie scrapes 0.xx% back.

Currently they're well over 100%, but everytime someone sells they drop this lower and lower.

It's going to take them a fucking long time to get it somewhere they're happy with, but the best thing you can do is **hold**.

**This also includes people selling to buy back in**, as this also allows the hedgie to shave off a small %

If you want to rebuy, so you get a better average per share, just hold and keep **buying the dips**.

This is the only way we can win.

**The hedges will drag this out for weeks/months if they are able to scrape small %s here and there.**

**Do NOT let them do this.**

-----

**If the hedgie cannot afford to pay us $1000 per share when should we sell?**

Good question, but it's just a figure of speech. The hedgie can afford to pay us $65k+ per share, but they don't want to make a loss.

They make a loss at anything over a few cents really, as they were basically betting that GME would go bankrupt.

But the higher the share price, the bigger a loss they make.

We are basically forcing them to buy from us at a price we set, but since we are millions of people, they can't make a deal with us and agree a set figure.

Therefore we are squeezing them, until the price rises up and up and up until we are happy, then we sell.

I'd say, sell anywhere from 5k to 10k per share, but I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just retarded.

-----

#TL;DR:

THE ONLY WAY WE CAN 100% WIN IS IF YOU DO NOT FUCKING SELL. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE REBUYING BACK IN AT A LOWER PRICE ON A DIP. DO NOT SELL. BUY MORE STOCKS ON DIPS, BUT DO NOT SELL.

HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD

2361,lae6j0,"Posting here for posterity because I want to try to explain why the fuck today was such a hard stall.

First things first: Full disclosure I am a fucking retard and I not a damn financial advisor. If someone can please correct me on any assumptions I made that will be fucking appreciated because I learn best from experience like any other degenerate ape.

So now to the main point. Why the fuck do I think the price of GME has stalled and dropped?

Answer: They are trying to short ladder but don't have enough shares available to tank the price completely so they are kinda short laddering with whatever shorts are available just to hold back the dam.

First: Lets understand what a short ladder is. A short ladder occurs when hedge funds coordinate with each other to purposely short one stock. They trade shorts with each other rapidly to drive the price down. Classic example of this was last week when the price dived from 450+ to under 200 (coupled with Robinhood backstabbing all of us)

Question: Why don't they do this shit infinitely?

Answer: it costs them a fuck ton of money to do so and they are already bleeding capital from the interest rate on their existing shorts.

Question: How the fuck do I know there is a short ladder attack?

Answer: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades

Does this shit look natural to you? Its Monday. Options aren't expiring. Look at the fucking share volume being done in constant streams of 100. Like wtf is this shit. It looks more like two desperate hedge fundies are playing hot potato with a 100 shares desperate to keep the price low because that's all they got.

Question: How do I know it isn't some paper handed bitches just bailing on us like little dicks?

Answer: https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

Today's buy order to sell order balance is fucking insane. As of this post at 12:38pm on 2/1/2021 its 136,000 buy orders to 35,000 sell orders. There are 4 times more fucking buyers than sellers right now.

Question: How the fuck do I know that there aren't any shorts available?

Answer: Fucking try right now. Go to fidelity, robinhood, interactive broker, or any other broker right now and TRY to short (obviously don't fucking actually short you degen ape). They are outright stating there are no stocks to short right now.

Question: So what do we do with this fucking information?

Answer: If you already bought as much as you can fucking stop looking at the market right now and screaming into the wind. If you are able to afford more fucking buy more during this dip. ALL PEOPLE NEED TO PLACE LIMIT ORDERS ON THEIR SHARES TO PREVENT YOUR FUCKING BROKERS FROM ALLOWING HEDGIES TO USE YOUR SHARES TO SHORT.

I am a class A fucking retard. I am holding this shit with diamond hands to the fucking moon.

TLDR: They are running out of shorts and can't fucking short enough to lower the price drastically so instead they are desperately shorting with what they have to stop the flood.

If you want to rebuy, so you get a better average per share, just hold and keep **buying the dips**.

This is the only way we can win.

**The hedges will drag this out for weeks/months if they are able to scrape small %s here and there.**

**Do NOT let them do this.**

**If the hedgie cannot afford to pay us $1000 per share when should we sell?**

Good question, but it's just a figure of speech. The hedgie can afford to pay us $65k+ per share, but they don't want to make a loss.

They make a loss at anything over a few cents really, as they were basically betting that GME would go bankrupt.

But the higher the share price, the bigger a loss they make.

We are basically forcing them to buy from us at a price we set, but since we are millions of people, they can't make a deal with us and agree a set figure.

Therefore we are squeezing them, until the price rises up and up and up until we are happy, then we sell.

I'd say, sell anywhere from 5k to 10k per share, but I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just retarded.

TL;DR:

THE ONLY WAY WE CAN 100% WIN IS IF YOU DO NOT FUCKING SELL. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE REBUYING BACK IN AT A LOWER PRICE ON A DIP. DO NOT SELL. BUY MORE STOCKS ON DIPS, BUT DO NOT SELL.

HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD

2387,lae6j0,"1. Remind everyone that these short attacks are in part to find your stop losses and snipe them.

2. Remind everyone that today's low close will be fed to the news media to manipulate sentiment - expect headlines and coverage saying ""we told you so, get out while you still can""; ""the squeeze is over""; ""the hedges have covered"" etc. This is designed to trigger a fear response in your brain.

3. Remind everyone to stop using robinhood

4. Remind everyone to buy when they can - the more real shares we lock up and hold, the fewer they have to buy and cover.

5. Remind everyone that even if they ladder this down to fucking $5 and start buying to cover the SP will, by definition, have to rise. They can't buy what they need to cover from each other, the math just doesn't work out.

6. Remind everyone there is a very good chance they were using fake shares in these short positions adding to the blatantly illegal activity we've seen thus far. There is legitimate DD on this possibility that's been posted here and on actual investing subreddits.

7. Remind everyone that it is not a loss until you sell. That is why your account says ""unrealized gains"" and ""unrealized losses."" Until you click the button it hasn't happened.

They're playing their *only remaining card* - **THEY'RE TRYING TO STRETCH IT OUT AND BRING OUR MORALE DOWN BEFORE THE PAYDAY!**

Suddenly there are tons of users that are saying they are *so happy* they will sell for 5k or even 2k! Meanwhile the news are saying we moved on!

IT'S DAMAGE CONTROL, THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE MAX PRICE PER SHARE THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY!

**DOWNVOTE IT AND POST THAT YOU'RE SELLING FOR $69,420 OR MORE - MAKE YOUR FELLOW APES FEEL SECURE!**

This tactic could work out for them - nobody wants to be left holding the empty bag, and it's hard to distinguish a shill from a paper-handed monkey.

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

THAT MEANS RETAIL OWN 280K x 10 = MATH TOO HARD BUT I THINK 3 MILLION AT LEAST?

THEN WE HAVE 7 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS IN WHICH 1M ARE BOTS. IF THEY BUY AT LEAST TWO GME THAT MEANS RETAIL OWNS ON TOTAL 6 x 2 = 12 MILLION

BLACKROCK HAS 10, FIDELITY HAS 10, THAT'S TOTAL 35 MILLION

Ima keep reposting this because it needs to be seen

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.",glnp9nu,1612246876.0,2021-02-02 08:21:16

1. The interest goes up as a function of price vs shorted price. 
2. With extra 2B injection from Citron some interests can be paid off. 
3. As terms and conditions specified in brokers app the firms borrow holders share to cover short. 
4. More shorts are created at higher price  then returns to the holders.
